For each run modify *args.py* to specify parameters and behavior, then run *launch.py* which calls *training.py* which contains the main experimental pipeline:
```
python launch.py
```

Model and dataset classes can be found in the other appropiately named files.  
The *scripts* folder contains matlab scripts for analysing generated data (specifically the *analysis.m* file).
